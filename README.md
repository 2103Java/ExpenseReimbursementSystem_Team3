## Getting Started

Before starting, you will need:
* Apache Tomcat Verion 9.x.
* Apache Maven Version 3.6 +.
* A Java IDE such as: Spring Tool Suite, Eclipse, etc.

To get this project on your machine, enter a directory you want the project stored in and run the following command:

       git clone https://github.com/2103Java/ExpenseReimbursementSystem_Team3 
       
1) In your IDE, use its' import feature to bring in the project

2) Still in the IDE, in your Tomcat's server.xml, select the port number you want this app to run on

3) Right click the 'ERS' folder, hover over 'Run as', and select 'Run on server'  (for Spring Tool Suite and Eclipse)

In your Web browser, enter the following URL:

      http://localhost:{portNumberYouUsed}/ERS/site/home

where {portNumberYouUsed} is the port number specified for Apache Tomcat to run on, above.

This will take you to the Expense Reimbursement System home page.
